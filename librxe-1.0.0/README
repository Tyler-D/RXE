Introduction
============

librxe is a userspace driver for a software RoCE implementation.  It works
as a plug-in module for libibverbs that allows userspace programs to use a
traditional Ethernet device as a the RoCE link layer.  See the libibverbs
package for more information.

Using librxe
============

librxe will be loaded and used automatically by programings linked with
libibverbs.  The ib_rxe and ib_rxe_net kernel modules must be loaded, and
a software RoCE device configured via the rxe_cfg utility.

Building
========
To make this directory, run:
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

Typically the autogen and configure steps only need be done the first time
unless configure.in or Makefile.am changes.
